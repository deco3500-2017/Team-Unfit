# Team-Unfit
Team Unfit Proposal 

## Introduction
Exercising can sometimes be a challenge for people as they struggle to stay motivated. People usually find fitness boring as they do not  like working out by themselves, working with a group of people can be much more motivating and fun, this can maintain a person more engaged and inspired to exercise. Team Fit aims to solve the problem of training long and boring sessions alone. Users can easily use the phone app to find a community to exercise along with, to achieve their personal best and goals. They are able to find training sessions based on the training category or their location. A session contains information about the date it is scheduled for, the location/location images and other users attending. 
## Ideal User
Our target user is someone looking to have access to a mobile app, that based on their location, are able to find a community of fitness partners for training sessions. Team Fit will allow user to find location based training sessions with a community of like minded people.

Rob is a 19yo UQ student. He currently owns a phone. He just moved to brisbane. He wants to be able to exercise more, lose weight and build muscle. However he feels lonely as he does not have any friends in Brisbane to exercise with, he wants to be able to find a community of friends around his same area that motivates him to be more active in a fun environment. He can’t afford a gym subscription whereby he prefers to find outdoor exercising methods.

Chris is a 38yo working father. Chris has a passion for cycling and has a few friends that he enjoys this hobby with on the weekend. Chris has been cycling with his friends for years now and he is looking for a new challenge. He know that there are other cyclists around his area but struggles to connect with them as they train at infrequent times. 

Sam is a 25yo workers. He is looking to fill that void left from his high school and college. He enjoys competing in groups and being pushed to his physical limits. He enjoys the journey more than the results. He is trying to expand his circle of friends and looking for a partner.

### User testing
Since anyone from any range of age is able to exercise, we will mainly access University of queensland students and friends, to help us with the user testing of our prototypes. The team will use visual prototyping tools, such as InVision to get the prototypes in hands of users and for the final prototype an app running in a phone to test users.

### User testing Methods
The main methods of user testing that the team will be using are questionnaires, interviews and observations. As this three methods allow to gather meaningful qualitative/quantitative data and feedback to improve every prototype stage.

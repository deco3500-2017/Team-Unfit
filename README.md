## Introduction
Exercising can sometimes be a challenge for people as they struggle to stay motivated. People usually find fitness boring as they do not  like working out by themselves, working with a group of people can be much more motivating and fun, this can maintain a person more engaged and inspired to exercise. Team Fit aims to solve the problem of training long and boring sessions alone. Users can easily use the phone app to find a community to exercise along with, to achieve their personal best and goals. They are able to find training sessions based on the training category or their location. A session contains information about the date it is scheduled for, the location/location images and other users attending. 
## Ideal User
Our target user is someone looking to have access to a mobile app, that based on their location, are able to find a community of fitness partners for training sessions. Team Fit will allow user to find location based training sessions with a community of like minded people.

Rob is a 19yo UQ student. He currently owns a phone. He just moved to brisbane. He wants to be able to exercise more, lose weight and build muscle. However he feels lonely as he does not have any friends in Brisbane to exercise with, he wants to be able to find a community of friends around his same area that motivates him to be more active in a fun environment. He can’t afford a gym subscription whereby he prefers to find outdoor exercising methods.

Chris is a 38yo working father. Chris has a passion for cycling and has a few friends that he enjoys this hobby with on the weekend. Chris has been cycling with his friends for years now and he is looking for a new challenge. He know that there are other cyclists around his area but struggles to connect with them as they train at infrequent times. 

Sam is a 25yo workers. He is looking to fill that void left from his high school and college. He enjoys competing in groups and being pushed to his physical limits. He enjoys the journey more than the results. He is trying to expand his circle of friends and looking for a partner.

### User testing
Since anyone from any range of age is able to exercise, we will mainly access University of queensland students and friends, to help us with the user testing of our prototypes. The team will use visual prototyping tools, such as InVision to get the prototypes in hands of users and for the final prototype an app running in a phone to test users.

### User testing Methods
The main methods of user testing that the team will be using are questionnaires, interviews and observations. As this three methods allow to gather meaningful qualitative/quantitative data and feedback to improve every prototype stage.

## Concept
Working out on your own can be difficult and according to research having a partner motivates you to exercise consistently, harder and decreases your chances of giving up. The idea behind this app is that it allows users to find a community of likeminded individuals with the same fitness goals and interests as yourself. All users will have to sign up and input information such as fitness goals, personal bests, their weight, and what area they live in (Users can decide which information is made public). This information will help users find workout sessions that are tailored for them.

When users have signed up they are then able to join or create workout sessions. Any user is able to create a workout session as different users may have experience in the fitness industry or are just seasoned fitness fanatics and feel they can help those wanting to get started. A workout session will contain the following information:

-          Name
-          Location
-          Date and time
-          A short description (what sort of exercises and training will occur)
-          Categories (e.g. Cardio, HIIT, Yoga etc.)
-          Difficulty (Beginner – Advanced)
-          Availability (Number of spots)

Once a user has joined a session they will also then have access to the session’s chat and will also receive notifications for changes to the session, messages from the chat and a reminder on the day of the session. When a user goes to a session they can add people that they meet through the app and then invite them to other sessions that they may be interested in going to.


This application aims to achieve the following:

Allow users to find workout sessions catered for their needs. This is largely based on their location, fitness goals and difficulty and interests.
Find users that have the same interests and goals as they do.
Create a safe and non-judgemental environment where users can workout


While there are hundreds of fitness apps available there isn’t anything similar to what this application is trying to achieve. Most fitness apps are personal, they provide users with workouts to do on their own, provide them with personal statistics, have users log their workouts or the food they eat. The social workout apps have users compete against one another with stats or if they are not competing there are discussions about their workouts and no actual working out. Where our app differs is that it gets users working out together in a real world setting and not just online. Many of these apps aren’t considering that some users may be new to working out and that comparing them to others with statistics may be more discouraging than motivating. We want our app to be used as a platform for people to meet and join sessions in an online setting and then workout together in a real world setting and help each other work on their fitness goals.


There are a few apps such as Dashr and Sidekick which have the same intention of having people find workout partners, however they were quite personal as you would usually meet with just one person. Where our app differs again is that group sessions are less intimidating as there are many people you can interact with and don’t have to get along with just one person.

Strava is an application that is similar to what the TeamFit app is trying to achieve. It is focussed on adding a social network that is supportive and allows you to share your achievements and workout routes with your friends. Implementing strava and fitbit into the app could prove to be beneficial in creating a more fun and supportive environment for our app.

# Stand Up Meeting

Andres Munoz

Mainly what I have done so far is work on the creation of the digital prototype with the help of Marvel app. The current low fidelity prototype comprehends of 7 windows: Log in, sign in, main menu, profile, friends and challenge. When users enter the challenge page they are able to find the fitness sessions based on their location, if an user enters on one of the sessions window they can see the details of the location, date, time and people that are attending that session.

What I will be working on for before the next stand up meeting will be mainly focus on the front end design of the next web based prototype, design different ideas of how the user interface and home page will look. Looking for different designs and colour schemes that are most appealing for the user eye.
